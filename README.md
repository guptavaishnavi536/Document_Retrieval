# Document_Retrieval

Question answering (QA) is a task that answers user's questions using a large collection of documents; it consists of two steps: (1) sort possible documents that contain the answer of a given question; and (2) extract the content from these documents and elaborate an answer to the user. For this project, we have explored techniques for identify the most similar document for a question, problem called Document Retrieval.

Statement: Given a question, the document retriever have to return the most likely  k  documents that contain the answer to the question.

The dataset used for this project is the Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQUAD dataset).
